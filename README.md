# Project Introduction  
**Applying Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning using the Hugging Face `peft` Library**  

Lightweight fine-tuning is a critical technique for adapting large foundation models to specific tasks without requiring significant computational resources. This project demonstrates how to implement parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) using the Hugging Face `peft` library, showcasing its efficiency and flexibility.  

## Key Objectives  
1. Explore parameter-efficient techniques for adapting pre-trained models.  
2. Evaluate the advantages of LoRA for lightweight fine-tuning.  
3. Compare and contrast the performance of pre-trained and fine-tuned models on a sentiment analysis task.

## Approach Overview  
### Lightweight Fine-Tuning for Sentiment Analysis using GPT-2  

- **PEFT Technique**  
   The project uses **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)** as the PEFT method. LoRA is chosen for its compatibility with various models and its ability to efficiently adapt foundation models with minimal resource requirements.  

- **Model**  
   The **GPT-2** model is selected due to its relatively small size and compatibility with:  
   - Sequence classification tasks.  
   - Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for efficient fine-tuning.  

- **Evaluation Metrics**  
   Model performance will be evaluated using Hugging Face's `Trainer` class, which simplifies training and evaluation workflows. Key metrics include:  
   - **Accuracy**: Measures the proportion of correctly predicted samples.  
   - **F1-Score**: Balances precision and recall for a robust performance evaluation.  

   These metrics enable a direct comparison between the pre-trained and fine-tuned model's effectiveness.  

- **Dataset**  
   The project utilizes the **IMDb dataset** from the Hugging Face `datasets` library. This dataset is a standard benchmark for binary sentiment classification tasks, making it ideal for evaluating the fine-tuned model's performance.
